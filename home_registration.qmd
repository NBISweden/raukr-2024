## Entry requirements

This workshop is aimed at both Ph.D. students and researchers within life sciences who are already using R for bioinformatics data analyses and who would like to start using R at a more advanced level. In order for you and other participants to benefit the most, you should *consider yourself eligible* if you are comfortable with:

- Reading and transforming data, 
- Installing and using third-party packages and 
- Plotting using standard R graphics.

## Selection

We can accomodate ~42 participants. Selection criteria include correct entry requirements, motivation to attend the workshop as well as gender and geographical balance. We do accept international applicants, but applicants affiliated to a Swedish institution are prioritized.

Once the registration period concludes, we will review your application and notify you of our decision. If accepted, you will have three working days to confirm your participation. Failure to do so would imply your inability to attend, and we will proceed accordingly. Once you confirmed, our course administrator will proceed with invoicing.

## Fee

The fee for academic participants is [8000 SEK]{.badge .badge-primary} subsidized by academic grants. Fee for non-academic participants is 16 000 SEK.

::: {.callout-warning}
If you register and are admitted but fail to attend without a valid reason (sickness or urgent family matter), you will still be liable for the entire fee.

::: {.callout-note}
The classroom windows may be left open in case the room gets warm. If you are easily disturbed by external noise, it might a good idea to bring noise cancelling headphones for practical labs (we are close to Visby harbor). Additional extension cables might come in handy too.
