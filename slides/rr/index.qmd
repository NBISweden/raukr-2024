::: {.notes}

A large percentage of research is not reproducible by other researchers or by the original researchers themselves. This concern has been lately addressed by several high profile journals.

## What is reproducibility?

> "reproducibility refers to the **ability** of a researcher **to duplicate the results** of a prior study using the same materials as were used by the original investigator. That is, a second researcher might use the same raw data to build the same analysis files and implement the same statistical analysis in an attempt to yield the same results…"

## Reproducibility in R

![](assets/turingway-reproduciblematrix.jpeg){width="85%"} 

.[from Turing way (<https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions.html>)]{.smaller}

## Typical workflow

1. Get data
2. Clean, transform data in spreadsheet
3. Copy-paste, copy-paste, ...
4. Run analysis & make figures
5. Write up a report attaching the figures
6. Need to modify the source data/analysis
7. Go back to step 2, Repeat
8. (after a couple of months) Need to fix the figures
9. Ask to myself which data I'm supposed to use now? (`data-final3` or `data-refined2`)
10. Realize the number of samples didn't match
11. Back to step 2, try to remember why some data was modified manually before

::: {.notes}

Manually handling workflow is hard to reproduce because it is hard to know the exact step carried out. A programmatic workflow allows full transparency to the exact steps followed.

:::

## Benefits of reproducibility


- Get the same results as before
- Rerunning workflow
- Additional data/New data
- Returning to a project
- Transferring projects
- Collaborative work
- Easy to make changes
- Eliminate copy-paste errors

::: {.notes}

A reproducible workflow allows a lot of convenience. 

- It's easy to automate re-running of analysis when earlier steps have changed such as new input data, code or assumptions. 
- Useful for an investigator returning to an analyses after a period of time.
- Useful when a project is transferred to a new investigator.
- Useful when working collaboratively.
- When you are asked to modify or change a parameter.

## Solutions

![](assets/rr-solutions.jpg)

- Containerised computing environment - *eg: Singularity, Docker*
- Workflow manager - *eg: Snakemake, Nextflow*
- Package and environment manager - *eg: renv, Conda*
- Track edits and collaborate coding - *eg: Git*
- Share and track code - *eg: GitHub, Bitbucket*
- Notebooks to document ongoing analyses - *eg: Jupyter*
- Analyze and generate reports - *eg: R Markdown*

A NBIS course of [**Tools for reproducible research**](https://nbis-reproducible-research.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

::: {.notes}

Reproducible projects can be performed at different levels. Reproducibility is the ability for a work to be reproduced by an independently working third-party.

:::

## Steps to reproducibility

- Avoid manual steps
- Documents containing analysis, code and results
- Note the software environment
- Self-contained portable project
- Results directly linked to code
- Contextual narrative to why a certain step was performed
- Version control of documents
- Keep the original data intact (read-only) with descriptions incl. how the data was obtained

::: {.notes}

Reproducible programming is not an R specific issue. R offers a set of tools and an environment that is conducive to reproducible research.

:::

## Environment

- Not about `environment()`
- Software environment around your code
- Operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux, ...)
- A particular version of R/Python
- Loaded package versions

## Software for environment management

- Operating system - *Singularity*, *Docker*

- R/Python - *Conda*

- Loaded package versions - *`renv`* package

## `renv` package

- **R env**ironment management package

- It helps our individual projects **isolated** so **portable**, and **reproducible**

- Local library of R packages

- Install `renv` package from CRAN or Conda

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("renv")
conda install -c conda-forge r-renv 
```

- Initialize local R environment using `renv`

```{r}
#| eval: false
renv::init()
```  

- Save the local library state

```{r}
#| eval: false
renv::snapshot()
```

- Restore the local library

```{r}
#| eval: false
renv::restore()
```

[https://kevinushey-2020-rstudio-conf.netlify.app/slides.html]{.smaller}

## Install R packages

- Use `renv::install` as below
- From CRAN : `renv::install("`*package name*`")` (e.g. `renv::install("dplyr")`)
- From Bioconductor : `renv::install("bioc::`*package name*`")` 
(e.g `renv::install("bioc::Biobase")`)
- From GitHub : `renv::install("`*user name*`/`*repository*`")` (e.g. `renv::install("StoreyLab/qvalue")`) 
- From GitLab/Bitbucket : `renv::install("[gitlab|bitbucket]::`*user name*`/`*repository*`")`

## RStudio • IDE

![](assets/rstudio.jpg){width="90%"}

- Code completion & Syntax highlighting (for many languages)
- R Notebook
- Debugging
- Useful GUI elements
- Multiple sessions can be opened in parallel

## RStudio • Project

**Create a new project**

![](assets/new-project.gif){width="90%"}

- Portable project (.Rproj)
- Dynamic reports
- Version control (git)
- Package management (`renv`)

## Project Structure

```
project_name/
+-- data/
|   +-- gene_counts.txt
|   +-- metadata.txt
+-- results/
|   +-- gene_filtered_counts.txt
|   +-- gene_vst_counts.txt
+-- images/
|   +-- exp-setup.jpg
+-- scripts/
|   +-- bash/
|   |   +-- fastqc.sh
|   |   +-- trim_adapters.sh
|   |   +-- mapping.sh
|   +-- r/
|       +-- qc.R
|       +-- functions.R
|       +-- dge.R
+-- report/
    +-- report.Rmd
```

- Organise data, scripts and results sensibly
- Keep projects self contained
- Use relative links

::: {.notes}

Try to organize all material related to a project in a common directory. Organise the directory in a sensible manner. Use relative links to refer to files. Consider raw as read-only content.

:::

## Publishing

- Quarto
- Markdown
- Rmarkdown

## RStudio • Project with Git

**Create a new project with version control**
![](assets/rstudio_git_new.gif)

- Version control : keep old versions and who/when files modified for what
- A repository in GitHub/Bitbucket

## RStudio • Git commit

**Log a set of changes using Git**
![](assets/rstudio_git_push.gif)
