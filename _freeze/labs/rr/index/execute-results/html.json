You can consult the [RMarkdown guide](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) or [RMarkdown cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf) for quick reference. A complete guide to RMarkdown is available [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).\n\n- Familiarise yourself with Markdown/RMarkdown/Quarto syntax and commonly used snippets.\n- Set up a project in R\n- Prepare an RMarkdown document\n- Add content and export to some common formats\n- Introduction to Quarto\n:::\n\n## RStudio\n\nCreate a new project in RStudio by going to `File > New Project > New Directory`. Select `New Project` if required. Then label the project name and the directory. An empty project is created. The R session has been refreshed. All variables are removed and the environment is cleared.\n\nCreate a new RMarkdown file by going to `File > New File > RMarkdown...`. Use the default options.\n\n## R environment\n\n### Conda\n\nThe environment within R is going to be managed by `renv`, while lower level, such as versions of R, can be managed by [Conda](https://docs.conda.io) management system. You can skip Conda at the moment, if you want, install `renv` package using `install.packages(\"renv\")` on R, and continue to `renv` section below, instead. Regarding Conda, please refer to the [link](https://docs.conda.io) for questions about the installation. If your project includes programs written in other programming languages, e.g. Python, the overall environment can be managed by Conda. NBIS has a dedicated workshop titled [**Tools for reproducible research**](https://nbis-reproducible-research.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which covers more on Conda and other programs for reproducible research.\n\nFor R, we can start with a simple environment file by creating a file named `environment.yml` having following text. It describes which versions of R, `renv` and `tidyverse` are to be installed. The file should be created on the folder of your project, as `fancy_project/environment.yml`.\n\n```      \nchannels:\n  - conda-forge\ndependencies:\n  - conda-forge::r=4.0\n  - conda-forge::r-renv=0.12.1\n  - conda-forge::r-tidyverse=1.3.0\n```\n\nUsing Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command line (Windows), run following commands to create an environment and activate it.\n\n```\nconda env create -n fancy_env -f environment.yml\nconda activate fancy_env\n```\n\n## renv\n\nThe environment within R, e.g. installed packages, is managed by `renv`. A good reference about the package is available at [**Introduction to `renv`**](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html).\n\n### Store R environment\n\nThe first step is the initialization of a local environment using the command in R below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrenv::init()\n```\n:::\n\n\nAs an alternative, you could choose to initialize `renv` when an R project is created as shown below. After the command, you may find `renv` folder and `renv.lock` file created. Check the file `renv.lock` using a text viewer or `less` command on Mac/Linux.\n\n![](assets/alternative_renv_init.png){width=\"400px\"}\n\nWhenever a package should be installed, please use `renv::install` instead of `install.packages` as below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrenv::install(\"dplyr\")  # from CRAN\nrenv::install(\"bioc::Biobase\")  # from Bioconductor\nrenv::install(\"StoreyLab/qvalue\")   # from GitHub\n# from GitLab/Bitbucket\n# renv::install(\"[gitlab|bitbucket]::`*user name*`/`*repository*`\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe current status of R environment of your project can be stored by calling `renv::snapshot()`. Please note that the function checks all R scripts under your R project folder. It updates `renv.lock` for the packages loaded in the scripts only. Check `renv.lock` file again after calling the `renv::snapshot()`. If no R script was created under the project folder yet, surprisingly no change in `renv.lock` will be found.\n\nNow, create a simple R script that loads one of the packages you installed, for example, a file named `test.R` that has just one line shown below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n:::\n\n\nCall `renv::snapshot()` and check the `renv.lock` file. You will see it becomes so long, now.\n\nThe `renv::snapshot()` command doesn't have to be called every time a package is installed. Just make sure it should be called when an environment is to be stored, e.g. before sharing the codes and the environment with colleagues.\n\n### Restore the environment\n\nThe environment can be restored on a new place by the commands below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrenv::init()\nrenv::restore()\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can test it by creating a new R project. Copy your scripts but also `renv.lock` to the folder of the new R project, run the commands above on R and find what the R installs. Please note that **no contents under `renv`** folder is needed to restore the R environment.\n\n",
